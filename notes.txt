Using the following to setup rsync between godaddy
http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-rsync-on-godaddy-hosting-account/

Vagrant box already had rsync installed

The following command worked to rsync to server.
rsync -avh -e ssh --rsync-path=bin/rsync ./working jerodh@jhtechservices.com:~/tmp/test

NOTE: Godaddy does not allow one to use keys to authenticate with ssh so you must type in password each time.
